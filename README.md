# workbench.pub

React + Vite + React Router frontend, Hono API, Cloudflare D1, and a cron Worker (`ingest/`).

## Deployment target: Workers with static assets (not Pages)

Cloudflare's Pages overview currently says "Start new projects with Workers." The compatibility matrix
also shows Cron Triggers and the broader feature set only on Workers, with D1 supported on both. So the
root `wrangler.toml` defines a Worker (`main = "functions/index.ts"`, a Hono app) that serves `dist/` as
static assets with SPA fallback, and runs first only for `/api/*`. D1 binding is `DB` in both
`wrangler.toml` and `ingest/wrangler.toml`.

Caveat: Workers only serves custom domains whose DNS is managed by Cloudflare, so workbench.pub must be
added as a Cloudflare zone. Pages-style file-based routing under `functions/` is not automatic; the Hono
app routes explicitly.

Verified 2026-11-07. Pinned versions: vitest 4.1.x (@cloudflare/vitest-plugin 1.6 accepts ^4.1 or ^5; it is the renamed @cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers), wrangler ^4.158, vite ^8.3, react 19, react-router-dom 7, hono ^4.13, typescript ^6.0.

## Scripts

`npm run dev` (Vite, proxies `/api` to wrangler on 8787), `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`.

## Tests

`vitest.workspace.ts` defines three projects: `node` (shared/, ingest/, scripts/), `workers` (D1 tests in the
Workers runtime: `shared/db.test.ts`, `ingest/src/apply.test.ts`, `functions/**`; applies `migrations/` when
it exists) and `jsdom` (React, `src/`). Vitest 4 has no workspace file, so `vitest.config.ts` loads it as
`test.projects`.
